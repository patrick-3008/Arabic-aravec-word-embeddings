## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patrick-3008/Arabic-aravec-word-embeddings.git
cd Arabic-aravec-word-embeddings
````

## Pre-trained Embeddings

Pre-trained word embeddings are included in this repository. You can find them in the `embeddings` directory. These embeddings are trained on a large corpus of Arabic text and can be used directly in your NLP applications.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the quality of the embeddings, you can use the included evaluation scripts. These scripts will help you assess the performance of the embeddings on various tasks, such as word similarity and analogy tasks.
